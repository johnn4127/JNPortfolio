Hi! My name is John Nguyen, and I am currently in the process of creating my software engineering portfolio. I'm incredibly grateful for the existence of template websites that are readily available for use.

The template I have utilized is from html5up.net, and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking an easy and efficient way to kickstart their own portfolio.

I have several exciting projects that are on my mind, and I'm committed to keeping this portfolio regularly updated. Wish me luck!
